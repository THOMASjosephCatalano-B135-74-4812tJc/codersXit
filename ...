What To ExpectWhat you Will need
The current demand for affordable rental units in Denver exceeds what is available. HOST, and the city, are increasing its annual investment in building new units as well as renovating/rehabbing older units, and strives to preserve the affordability of all projects for as long as possible. 

The city invests in new units as well as the rehabilitation and renovation of existing units.  Many projects accept wait list applications.  Other properties have so many approved applicants that waiting lists are closed. If there is a property you like, you may need to check back with them over time. 

Covenant guidelines define your eligibility to rent an affordable unit and you must remain income-eligible each year to renew your lease. You may not add an income-earning household member without notifying the property manager or leasing agent, whether they are helping you pay the rent or not.
