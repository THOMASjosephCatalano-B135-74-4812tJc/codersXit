the requisite hardware encoding & systems implantation software program for the immediate
requirement of BINARY/BIT encoding/decoding for syncronys 
time scaler arithmetic

Introduction

The requirement to implement a dynamic new language with 
non-silicon computer in mind for true time synchronization, only achievable by 
full spatial rendering in quantum; processor architecture/computing
(ie. the; median-free liquid-filled full-spatial photonic BIT transfer processor/computer 

Overall concentration will include floating point
binding arrays.
