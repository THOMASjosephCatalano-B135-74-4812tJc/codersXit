the requisite Assembly implantation for the immediate
requirement of BINARY/BIT encoding/decoding for syncronys 
time scaler arithmetic

Introduction

The requirement to implement a dynamic new language with the
non-silica computer for time synchronization only 

Overall concentration will include floating point
binding arrays, for example the requirement to fulfill
spatial vectorization as fractal whole sum plots.
